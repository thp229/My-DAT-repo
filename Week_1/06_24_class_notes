#What is a data-scientist?
## "knows more about stats than a programmer, more about programming than statistician"

#Basic skills::
##<1> Python programming / and R language

##<2> Data collection/Cleaning

##<3> Conceptual fluency with Statistical techniques
    #descriptive stats
    #understanding of distributions
    #regression
    #different machine learning methods

####################
## The Python Stack ##
####################

###Numpy -- linear algebra

###Scipy -- basic stats

###Statsmodels -- advanced stats
####p_values etc

###Scikit-Learn -- ML
# ?Tensorflow?
####predictive modeling

###Pandas -- data munging
####data cleaning

###Matplotlib -- visualizations

#definition of Machine Learning::
##"The broader notion of building statistical artifacts that become more accurate
## over time based on experience"

#Cost Functions
##distance between prediction vector and true_answer vector
###Ex/ euclidean dist for cts data

#types of Machine Learning problems::

#Regression vs Classification
# --Regression is used to predict cts variables
# --Classification is used to predict discrete categories

#Supervised (structured) vs Unsupervised (unstructured)
# --relates to the data sources being used

# --Supervised variables are clearly defined and labeled ex/ Economic Data
        #think Generalized Linear Models
# --Unsupervised data is not clearly labeled ex/ Image Data
        #not trying to solve for something specific
        #think clustering/grouping based on similarity
